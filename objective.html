		<h2>Dancing Dots!</h2>

		

		<p> Test your memory with increasingly complicated memory challenges. </p>

		<p>Dancing Dots has fifteen levels. Each level consists of three games. Each game requires you to remember the pattern in which dots are displayed to you and then click on the same dots, in the same order.</p>

		<p>Level one is two games of one dot each. Level two is two games of two dots. Level thre and above are three games each with the level number representing the number of dots. As you climb through the levels, the challenge to your memory increases. Beware! If you click on the wrong dot, you are bumped back to the previousl level. </p>
