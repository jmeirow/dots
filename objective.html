		<h2>Memory Madness!</h2>

		

		<p> Test your memory with increasingly complicated memory challenges. </p>

		<p>Memory Madness has fifteen levels. Each level consists of three games. Each game requires you to remember the pattern in which dots are displayed to you and then click on the same dots, in the same order.</p>

		<p>Level one is three games of one dot each. Level two is three games of two dots, and so on. As you climb through the levels, the challenge to your memory increases. Beware! If you click on the wrong dot, you are bumped back to the previousl level. </p>
		<br/>

		<p> How many levels can you reach? By clicking the link below, you'll proceed to the game, which will start within two seconds, so be prepared. Just watch the dots and then click on the black dots in the order they were displayed to you. Good luck!!
